Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (e.g., a student's final exam score) and one or more independent variables (e.g., study hours, class attendance, or prior test scores). It is particularly useful in educational contexts for predicting performance based on observable factors.
Steps in Using Linear Regression:
1.Data Collection: Gather relevant data, such as historical exam scores, hours of study, or class participation rates.
2.Data Preprocessing: Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.
3.Model Training: Fit the linear regression model using a training dataset.
4.Evaluation: Use metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the model's performance.
5.Prediction: Apply the trained model to predict scores for new students based on their inputs.
